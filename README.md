Spock - Rock - Lizzard - Scissors - Paper is a fun game site that has been created to help kids (and anyone else that like the show "The Big Bang Theory") have a little fun and pass the time. The game is a modern twist (based off of the charechter Sheldon Coopers's concept) of the original Rochambeau game better known as the folk game rock-paper-scissors. The twist is adding two more hand shape possibilities in an effort to statistically reduce the possabilities of the players choosing the same hand shape resulting in a draw. This program is set to be a "Best of 7" series so the player/computer has to win 4 games to win the series.

The game in itself is fairly simple and takes little skill to play as each round (especially when played against a computer) is won more on luck than anything else. There for its the perfect game to entertain children and occasionally, fans of the show. 

features of site: The site feateures one main page that is completely responsive to fit on to any screen size. On the main page there is a picture description showing which hand formation beats another hand formation. Below the picture there are 5 buttons, one for each of the hand shapes. All the player has to do is pick which hand shape they think will win against the computer.

Directly below the 5 "Player Choice buttons" is the presentation area fo rthe computers randomly chosen hand shape. The program then states who wins and near the botoom of the page there is a score counter for the player and the computer. The first competitor to gain four victories wins the series. At the bottom of the page there is a reset button to start the series all over again.



future features to include:

1. In the future I would like to make it possible to have the game have a second player option so that more than one person can enjoy the game.

2. Also, I think that it would be good to link this game with a series of other kid friendly games of similar skill levels, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.


testing methods and results:

1. Using https://validator.w3.org/, each page was tested repeatedly to track and debug errors in the code, until all errors were eliminated in all pages of the code.

2. using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator, the css stylesheet was tested to track errors and debugged until there are no errors in the code.

3. Using Chrome Dev Tools to trouble shoot and test all pages repeatedly to track and debug the code for all the pages.

Deployment:

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

Enter the GitHub repository.

Navigate to the Settings tab, then selecting the 'pages link on the left side link section. selecting the source section in the drop tab, select the Master Branch.

Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed green ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
